In this project, I designed an interactive financial dashboard using Plotly to visualize and analyze key profitability metrics across three financial products: Credit Card, Overdraft, and Guarantee. The dashboard calculates and displays Return on Equity (ROE), LIBT (Liabilities Before Tax), and revenue breakdowns for each product.
